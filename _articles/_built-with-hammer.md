#Built with Hammer

I figured the first post I'm making in this "sort of" blog should be an ode to the wonderful tool I'm using to build this site. I've bought [Hammer for Mac](http://hammerformac.com/) on a whim â€” I was looking for a simple way to build static sites and mockups, and Hammer seemed like a nice way to go.
